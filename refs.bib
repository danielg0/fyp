abstract = {Simpoint technology (Sherwood et al., 2002) has been widely used by modern micro-architecture research community to significantly speedup the simulation time. However, the typical Simpoint size remains to be tens to hundreds of million instructions. At such sizes, the cycle-accurate simulators still need to run tens of hours or even days to finish the simulation, depending on the architecture complexity and workload characteristics. In this paper, we developed a new simulation framework by integrating LiveCache and Detail-warmups with Dromajo ( https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tools/Dromajo.html) and Kabylkas et al. (2005), enabling us to use much smaller Simpoint size (2 million instructions) without loss of accuracy. Our evaluation results showed that the average simulation time can be accelerated by 9.56 times over 50M size and most of the workload simulations can be finished in tens of minutes instead of hours.}

abstract = {Modern architecture research relies heavily on detailed pipeline simulation. Simulating the full execution of a single industry standard benchmark at this level of detail takes on the order of months to complete. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that to properly perform an architectural evaluation requires multiple benchmarks to be evaluated across many separate runs. To address this issue we recently created a tool called SimPoint that automatically finds a small set of Simulation Points to represent the complete execution of a program for efficient and accurate simulation. In this paper we describe how to use the SimPoint tool, and introduce an improved SimPoint algorithm designed to significantly reduce the simulation time required when the simulation environment relies upon fast-forwarding.},
